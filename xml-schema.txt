XML Schema
==========
* defines elements that can appear in a document
* defines attributes that can appear in a document
* defines which elements are child elements
* defines the order of child elements
* defines the number of child elements
* defines whether an element is empty or can include text
* defines data types for elements and attributes
* defines default and fixed values for elements and attributes


XML Schemas are the Successors of DTDs
======================================
We think that very soon XML Schemas will be used in most Web
applications as a replacement for DTDs. Here are some reasons:
* XML Schemas are extensible to future additions
* XML Schemas are richer and more useful than DTDs
* XML Schemas are written in XML
* XML Schemas support data types
