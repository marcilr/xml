Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of
rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and
machine-readable.  It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification[2] produced by
the W3C, and several other related specifications,[3] all free open
standards.[4]
