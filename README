  Email form Jason G. recommending XML Data Binding page:

  I found this paper on the web by a guy who has summarized XML
  serialization and data binding, different approaches, pros and cons,
  etc. very succinctly. He then follows up with links to various open and
  closed tools/libs/products that can help get the job done.

  It's available at:
